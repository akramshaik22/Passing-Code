  Question - 2:
You are provided an array of size A that contains N non-negative integers. Your task is to determine whether the number that is formed by selecting the last digit of all the N numbers is divisible by 10.

Input format:
First line: A single integer N denoting the size of array 
Second line:  N space-separated integers.

Output format:
If the number is divisible by 10, then print YES. Otherwise, print NO.

Constrains:
1 <= N <= 10^5
0 <= A[i] <= 10^5
Time: 1 sec

  Input:
  5
  85 96 34 23 92

  Output:
  NO

Explanation:
56432 obtained by taking last digits of all numbers in the array is not divisible by 10, so output is NO
