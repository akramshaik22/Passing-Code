  Question - 6:
Harish wants to search for repeated strings in the given list of strings. Help to complete his work fast by writing a code. A string is said to be repeated, if it contains a sub-string which is multiplied to form given string.

Input format:
First line: n, number of strings
Next n lines contain strings

Output format:
n lines 0 and 1, 0 if string is not repeating and 1 for repeating strings.

Constrains:
1 <= n <= 100
Time: 1 sec

  Input:
  2
  abbabbabb ababa

  output:
  1
  0

Explanation:
In above test case
First string "abbabbabb" is accepted, because it has a repeating substring "abb" and if we multiply this sub string for 3 times we get the original string.
Second string "ababa" is not accepted, because it has no substring that forms the original string.
