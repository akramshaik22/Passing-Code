  Question - 1:
Surya wants to print string in a design. Write a code to print the given string in required pattern.

Input format:
First line: n, length of string
Second line: string with n characters
Output format:
Required pattern

Constrains:
1 <= n <= 50
Time: 1 sec

  Input:
  5
  print

  output:
  p
  p r
  p r i
  p r i n
  p r i n t

  Question - 2:
You are provided an array of size A that contains N non-negative integers. Your task is to determine whether the number that is formed by selecting the last digit of all the N numbers is divisible by 10.

Input format:
First line: A single integer N denoting the size of array 
Second line:  N space-separated integers.

Output format:
If the number is divisible by 10, then print YES. Otherwise, print NO.

Constrains:
1 <= N <= 10^5
0 <= A[i] <= 10^5
Time: 1 sec

  Input:
  5
  85 96 34 23 92

  Output:
  NO

Explanation:
56432 obtained by taking last digits of all numbers in the array is not divisible by 10, so output is NO

  Question - 3:
Akram was developing chess game. While developing the chess game he wants to know the no of move his rook(elephant) can moves from the current position. Write a code to count the total no of moves rook can move.

Input format:
First line: integer N size of chess board(NxN)
Second line: two space separated integers specifying the position

Note :- A rook can Move only in forward, backward, right, left directions from its current Position.

Output format:
Number of moves

Constrains:
1 <= N <= 10^5
Time: 1 sec

  Input:
  5
  2 2

  Output:
  8

  Question - 4:
Akram and Surya are checking for anagram strings to complete their homework. Write a code to check weather two strings are anagrams are not. Two strings are said to be anagrams if the count of each character in the strings are equal.

Input format:
First line: n number of characters in each string.
Second line: Two strings in new line.

Output format:
YES, if strings are anagrams else NO.

Constrains:
1 <= n <= 10^3
Time: 1 sec

  Input1:
  4
  race
  care

  output1:
  YES

  Input2:
  5
  hello
  world

  output2:
  NO

  Question - 5:
Bhargav wants to manipulate a given String in such a way that, he will replace all occurrences of a character Ai in the string with N space, where N is the ith Fibonacci number.

Input format:
First line: string to be manipulate
Second line: character to be replaced

Output format:
String

Constrains:
1 <= size of string <= 10^3
Time: 1sec

  Input0:
  babbadab
  a

  output0:
  bbb d b

  Input1:
  23563435637
  3

  Output1:
  256 4 56  7

Explanation:
Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on.
2 + [0 space] + 56 + [1 space] + 4 + [1 space] + 56 + [2 space] + 7
Here 3 is replaced with n no of space where n is ith Fibonacci number.

  Question - 6:
Harish wants to search for repeated strings in the given list of strings. Help to complete his work fast by writing a code. A string is said to be repeated, if it contains a sub-string which is multiplied to form given string.

Input format:
First line: n, number of strings
Next n lines contain strings

Output format:
n lines 0 and 1, 0 if string is not repeating and 1 for repeating strings.

Constrains:
1 <= n <= 100
Time: 1 sec

  Input:
  2
  abbabbabb ababa

  output:
  1
  0

Explanation:
In above test case
First string "abbabbabb" is accepted, because it has a repeating substring "abb" and if we multiply this sub string for 3 times we get the original string.
Second string "ababa" is not accepted, because it has no substring that forms the original string.
