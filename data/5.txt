  Question - 5:
Bhargav wants to manipulate a given String in such a way that, he will replace all occurrences of a character Ai in the string with N space, where N is the ith Fibonacci number.

Input format:
First line: string to be manipulate
Second line: character to be replaced

Output format:
String

Constrains:
1 <= size of string <= 10^3
Time: 1sec

  Input0:
  babbadab
  a

  output0:
  bbb d b

  Input1:
  23563435637
  3

  Output1:
  256 4 56  7

Explanation:
Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on.
2 + [0 space] + 56 + [1 space] + 4 + [1 space] + 56 + [2 space] + 7
Here 3 is replaced with n no of space where n is ith Fibonacci number.
